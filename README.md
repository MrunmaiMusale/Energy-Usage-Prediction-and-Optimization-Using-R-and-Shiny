# Energy-Usage-Prediction-and-Optimization-Using-R-and-Shiny
 Developed linear regression and decision tree models to forecast energy usage variations due to global warming. Conducted data preparation, exploratory analysis, and demand prediction using R packages (tidyr, dplyr, caret, kernlab, MASS). Created a Shiny app to visualize predictions and propose demand reduction strategies.
